# Financial Analysis Agent - Hackathon Submission

## üèÜ Competition Overview

This project was developed for the **Financial Analysis Agent Hackathon**, focusing on creating an intelligent financial analysis system that leverages large language models (LLMs) and agentic workflows to comprehend complex financial contexts, investment strategies, and economic principles.

## üéØ Project Description

Our Financial Analysis Agent is designed to:

- **Comprehend Financial Contexts**: Process and analyze complex financial data and scenarios
- **Investment Strategy Analysis**: Provide insights on investment decisions and portfolio management
- **Economic Principle Application**: Apply established economic theories and principles
- **Ethical Decision-Making**: Ensure all financial recommendations adhere to ethical standards
- **Multi-Language Support**: Handle both English and Thai financial queries

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The system employs a sophisticated multi-stage workflow built with **n8n** that processes financial queries through several specialized agents:

### Core Components

1. **Question Classifier (T1/T2)** - `Classifier_T1_T2.js`

   - Identifies question types (Multiple Choice vs. Rise/Fall predictions)
   - Preprocesses time-series data for stock predictions
   - Supports both English and Thai language inputs

2. **Category Classifier** - `Classify_category.js`

   - Categorizes questions into 11 CFA curriculum domains:
     - Ethics and Professional Standards
     - Quantitative Methods
     - Economic Analysis and Market Forces
     - Financial Reporting and Analysis
     - Corporate Finance and Issuers
     - Equity Investments
     - Fixed Income Investments
     - Derivative Instruments
     - Alternative Investments
     - Portfolio Management
     - Unclassified (General Knowledge)

3. **Specialized Agents**

   - **T1 Agent**: Handles multiple-choice questions with domain-specific prompting
   - **T2 Agent**: Focuses on stock price prediction (Rise/Fall) with technical analysis

4. **Output Formatter** - `Format_output.js`
   - Standardizes responses into consistent JSON format
   - Handles error cases and malformed outputs

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Workflow Architecture (`financial_analysis_workflow.json`)

The n8n workflow orchestrates the following process:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Input Query] --> B[Question Type Classification]
    B --> C{Question Type?}
    C -->|Type 1: Multiple Choice| D[Category Classification]
    C -->|Type 2: Rise/Fall| E[Time-series Processing]
    D --> F[Domain-Specific Agent T1]
    E --> G[Stock Prediction Agent T2]
    F --> H[Output Formatting]
    G --> H
    H --> I[Final Response]
```

### Key Features

- **Multi-Modal Processing**: Handles both structured (time-series) and unstructured (text) data
- **Domain Expertise**: Specialized prompting based on CFA curriculum categories
- **Ethical Framework**: Built-in ethical guidelines for financial recommendations
- **Performance Optimization**: Designed for speed and accuracy balance
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management and fallback mechanisms

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **n8n** workflow automation platform
- **Ollama** or compatible LLM provider
- Node.js runtime for custom JavaScript functions

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd financial_analysis_agent
```

2. Import the n8n workflow:

   - Open n8n interface
   - Import `financial_analysis_workflow.json`
   - Configure your preferred LLM provider and models

3. Set up model credentials:
   - Configure LLM API credentials in n8n
   - Ensure your chosen models are available and accessible

### Usage

#### API Endpoint

Send POST requests to the workflow webhook with the following format:

```json
{
  "question": "Your financial analysis question here..."
}
```

#### Example Queries

**Multiple Choice Question:**

```json
{
  "question": "Which of the following best describes portfolio diversification? A) Investing in one sector B) Spreading investments across different assets C) Focusing on high-risk investments D) Avoiding international markets"
}
```

**Stock Prediction:**

```json
{
  "question": "Based on the following data, will the stock price rise or fall tomorrow?\nContext: Date,Close,Volume\n2024-01-01,100.50,1000000\n2024-01-02,102.30,1200000\n2024-01-03,101.80,1100000"
}
```

#### Response Format

```json
{
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Portfolio diversification involves spreading investments across different asset classes, sectors, and geographic regions to reduce risk. This strategy helps minimize the impact of poor performance in any single investment on the overall portfolio."
}
```

## üîç Algorithm Details

### Question Classification

The system uses keyword matching and pattern recognition to classify questions into two main types:

- **Type 1**: Multiple choice questions requiring domain expertise
- **Type 2**: Stock price prediction requiring time-series analysis

### Domain-Specific Prompting

Each CFA curriculum category has specialized prompting strategies:

- **Mermaid diagrams** for step-by-step analysis workflows
- **Domain-specific validation rules**
- **Conservative decision-making for ambiguous cases**

### Time-Series Analysis

For stock predictions, the system:

- Extracts closing prices from CSV data
- Calculates percentage changes and trends
- Generates summary statistics for AI analysis
- Applies technical analysis principles

## üõ°Ô∏è Ethical Framework

The system incorporates robust ethical guidelines:

- **Fiduciary Duty**: Prioritizes client interests
- **Transparency**: Clear reasoning for all recommendations
- **Conservative Approach**: Chooses safer options when uncertain
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Adheres to financial industry standards
